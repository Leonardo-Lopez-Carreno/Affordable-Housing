    <h1>How Affordable Housing is Threatened in NYC</h1>

    <p>In May of 2021, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development published “How is Affordable Housing Threatened in Your Neighborhood?” This annual report brings together multiple datasets to evaluate which New York City neighborhoods are currently facing the most threats to affordable housing, and what factors have played a role in this endangerment. However, as extensive and thorough as the report is, it can be difficult to process such a large amount of data. Therefore, here are a few takeaways:</p>

            <p>The first and perhaps most obvious conclusion is the high imbalance across New York City boroughs. Out of the ten neighborhoods that were deemed to be most at risk in terms of affordable housing, eight of them were in the Bronx. Several neighborhoods were among the most severely impacted in each factor considered, whether they were directly related to housing (evictions, litigations, etc.) or not.</p>

      <p>There was also a clear relationship between the neighborhoods’ demographics and their housing risk. Most of the highly endangered areas had a significantly higher amount of residents of color than the rest, as well as a lower rate of area median income (AMI.)</p>

      <div class="container bullet">

      <img src="covid.png" alt="covid">
      <p>The dataset also takes into consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in these statistics. The ten most endangered neighborhoods were among the 20 community districts with the highest rate of COVID cases. They also had the highest percentage of service workers, who have a higher possibility of COVID exposure because of their job.</p>

      <div class="container bullet">

      <img src="rent.png" alt="rent">
      <p>There are also factors directly related to housing itself. Seven out of the most endangered neighborhoods displayed a significant percentage of rent burden among its residents. They also showed a notably higher rate of evictions and housing litigations.</p>

      <p>Taking everything into consideration, the ANHD’s report allows us to take a comprehensive look at the issues that endanger affordable housing. It shows the communities and demographics that have been more harshly affected by them, as well as how the COVID-19 pandemic made issues that were already present even more harmful to these communities.</p>
